In this assignment Database first approach has been taken. First, a database with three table has been created with necessary properties. 
Two tables - a. Category and b. Product has (one-to-many) relations. Stored procedure for product table has also been initiated. View-Model class created for each models respectively. 
Then using Ado.net Entity Model (RestaurantModel.edmx) implemented all the three tables. Three controllers are also created for Category, Product and Schedule.
Categories- part is implemented by MVC technique with entity framework contains CRUD operation and has its own different views for Index, Edit, Details, Delete and Create.

Second part is Product where ado.net and stored procedure has been used for storing data. 
Web Api technique is implemented in Products Controller and jQuery/Ajax used to do CRUD operations from the client site which is handled through Web Api. 
Scripts>custom>product.js contains code for calling jquery/ajax functionalities with different methods.
